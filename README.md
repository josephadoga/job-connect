# JobConnect: Hiring Expert
This application is a simplified version of LinkedIn, created using the Random User API. It has a 
user login page (index) and a main page (home).

### Features
- User Login Page: The login section comprises of a validated form that asks for a username and 
password. Upon clicking the login button, the system compares the provided credentials with the 
stored data in ```localStorage```. If the comparison is successful, the user is redirected to the homepage; 
otherwise, an error message is displayed.

- Homepage: The homepage features a ```3-column layout```. Users can view their profile information, post 
images or text, or both and connect with other users.

- Random User Integration: The application fetches user data from the ```Random User API``` to populate the 
homepage with profile pictures, full names, and cities of other users. At least 10 random users are 
displayed, providing a social networking experience.
